This was basically ported by hand from my C# code of the original mathmatical formula that was posted on the internet to calculate DPS of borderlands 2 weapons (works for borderlands 3) and it seems accurate because when you sort inventory by score in BL3 it does really give you sort of the best possible DPS weapons, but this is great for calculating the dps from vendor weapons or legendaries you aren't sure which one is better.
